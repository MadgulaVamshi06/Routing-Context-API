React Routing Implementation:
I observed how React Router simplified navigation and routing within my React application.
I learned how to structure routes for different components/pages and handled nested routes effectively.
I understood how route parameters and query parameters could be utilized to pass data between components/pages.

Context API Usage:
I realized the benefits of centralizing state management with the Context API, especially for sharing data across multiple components.
I learned how to create and consume contexts to provide application-wide data and functionalities.
I organized contexts based on the logical separation of concerns within the application.

External API Integration:
I recognized the significance of external API integration in modern web development for accessing dynamic data and services.
I learned how to use Axios to make API requests and handle responses asynchronously.
I gained experience in dealing with authentication mechanisms, such as token-based authentication, and securely managed tokens.
